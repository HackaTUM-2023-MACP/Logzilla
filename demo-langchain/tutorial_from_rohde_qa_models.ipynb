    "# Introduction to Question Answering with Transformers\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook! Here, we will explore how to use transformer models for question answering tasks, especially in the context of analyzing long texts such as log files. This introduction will help you get up to speed quickly, so you can focus on the actual task of the hackathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Question Answering?\n",
    "Question Answering (QA) is a field of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on building systems that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language. A QA system can be as simple as a database lookup or as complex as a machine learning model that understands context, semantics, and even nuances in language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Transformers for QA?\n",
    "Transformer models, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\", have revolutionized the field of NLP. They have shown state-of-the-art results in various tasks, including question answering. Transformer models, like BERT, T5, or GPT-3, are pre-trained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tuned for specific tasks like QA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of transformers is their ability to understand the context of a sentence by using self-attention mechanisms. This makes them particularly useful for QA tasks, where understanding the context is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Long Texts\n",
    "One challenge with transformer models is their limitation in handling long sequences due to memory constraints. Most transformer models can handle sequences of around 512 tokens. However, in real-world scenarios like log file analysis, we often deal with much longer texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, we can split the long text into smaller chunks, generate answers for each chunk, and then select the best answers based on some scoring mechanism. This approach allows us to apply powerful transformer models to long texts without running into memory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Started\n",
    "In this notebook, we will guide you through the process of setting up a transformer model for QA, splitting long texts into manageable chunks, and finding the best answers to your questions. We hope this will give you a head start in the hackathon and inspire you to build amazing things!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"

    "## The Problem\n",
    "The code below runs, but then, disaster strikes. We encounter a RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (589) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1. What happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that transformer models like BERT have a maximum token length they can handle, usually around 512 tokens. Our text far exceeds this limit, causing the model to run out of memory."

    "context = \"\"\"germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a country in the western region of Central Europe. It is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany is situated between the Baltic and North seas to the north, and the Alps to the south. Its 16 constituent states are bordered by Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state was commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation later transformed in 1871 into the German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, in 1949, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany, while Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.\n",
    "\n",
    "Germany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe, the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country it offers social security, a universal health care system and a tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, European Union, NATO, Council of Europe, G7, G20, and OECD. It has the third-greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\"\"\"\n",

    "## One possible solution:\n",
    "This example highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of transformer models when dealing with long texts. Simply throwing a long text at a transformer model without considering its token length limit will likely result in failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section of this notebook, we'll explore strategies for effectively handling long texts in transformer models for QA tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Long Texts with Transformers: A Practical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we saw how naively applying a transformer model to a long text can lead to errors. But don't worry! We've developed a set of Python functions as possible solution for handling long texts in transformer models for QA tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the approach we've outlined below is a practical solution for handling long texts with transformer models, it's by no means the only or the best solution. There are several ways you could improve upon our code or implement your own solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could experiment with different chunk sizes and overlaps to see if they yield better results. You could also try different ways of ranking the answers, such as using different similarity measures or incorporating additional information into the ranking process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are many existing repositories on the internet that provide solutions for handling long texts with transformer models. These repositories often include more advanced techniques and optimizations, and can be a great resource for improving your own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the key to success in machine learning is experimentation and continuous learning. Don't be afraid to try new things and learn from others. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting Text into Chunks\n",
    "To overcome the token length limit of transformer models, we split the long text into smaller chunks (see \"split_context\" below). Each chunk is of a specific size that the model can handle, and the chunks overlap a bit to ensure we don't miss any information that could be at the boundaries of the chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asking Questions on Each Chunk\n",
    "We then feed each chunk to the model and collect the answers (see \"answer_question\" below). This ensures that the model considers the question in the context of each chunk of the long text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ranking the Answers\n",
    "Once we have the answers, we need a way to determine which one is the best (see \"find_best_answer\" below). For this, we use the concept of vectorizing the answers and the question (see \"vectorize_text\" below), and then calculating the cosine similarity between them (see \"calculate_similarity\" below). The answer with the highest cosine similarity to the question is considered the best answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to leverage the power of transformer models for QA tasks on long texts, without running into memory issues or the need for complex fine-tuning. It's a practical and effective solution for tasks like log file analysis, where the texts can be very long.\n",

Its 16 constituent states are bordered by Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west.

In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.\n",

After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was in turn transformed into the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, in 1949, Germany as a whole was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany, while Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact.

    "## Using Vectorization for Text Summarization\n",
    "Vectorization is not only useful for ranking answers in a QA task, but also for summarizing large texts like log files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a summary or a shorter version of a log file is a practical and efficient approach for several reasons. Firstly, asking questions to a full log can be time-consuming due to the large amount of data that needs to be processed (see code cell below which can take multiple minutes for a longer log file! Execute the code above to have all libraries loaded). This can lead to slower response times and a less efficient system overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, asking questions to a compact summary is much faster. The system only needs to process a smaller amount of data, which can significantly improve response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a summarized version of a log file is more user-friendly. Users can quickly get an overview of the information without having to sift through large amounts of data. This makes it easier for users to find the information they need and improves the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, summarizing log files can lead to a more efficient and user-friendly system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple approach to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunking: As before, split the log file into smaller chunks that the transformer model can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vectorization: Convert each chunk into a vector. This will give you a set of vectors that represent the content of your log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering: Use a clustering algorithm like K-means to group the vectors. Each cluster will represent a 'topic' in your log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarization: For each cluster, choose the chunk whose vector is closest to the centroid of the cluster as the 'summary' of that topic. You could also consider using a transformer model trained for summarization to further condense these representative chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will give you a summary of the main topics in your log file, which can be very useful for understanding the overall content and identifying any issues or important events. However, keep in mind that this is a very basic approach and there are many more advanced techniques for text summarization out there.\n"

    "## Using Vectorization for Highlighting Relevant Log Lines\n",
    "Vectorization can also be used to highlight the log lines that are most relevant to a given user question or answer provided by the transformer model. Here's a way to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunking: As before, split the log file into smaller chunks that the transformer model can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vectorization: Convert each chunk into a vector. This will give you a set of vectors that represent the content of your log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question/Answer Vectorization: Convert the user question or the answer provided by the transformer model into a vector using the same method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarity Calculation: Calculate the cosine similarity between the question/answer vector and each chunk vector. This will give you a measure of how relevant each chunk is to the question or answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Highlighting: Use these similarity scores to create a heatmap of the log file, where each line's color intensity corresponds to its chunk's similarity score. This will visually highlight the lines that are most relevant to the question or answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can help users quickly identify the parts of the log file that are most relevant to their question or the model's answer, making it easier to understand and troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, this is just one way to do this, and there are many other techniques you could use to highlight relevant log lines based on vectorization. Feel free to experiment and find the method that works best for your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Success of the Log File Summarization and QA System\n",
    "Measuring the success of the log file summarization and QA system is crucial for understanding its effectiveness and for making necessary improvements. Here are some methods to evaluate the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self-Evaluation: Use your own judgement to evaluate the system. Ask yourself: Does the summary accurately represent the key points of the log file? Are the answers provided by the QA transformer relevant and accurate? Are the highlighted lines in the log file helpful and do they correspond to the question or answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automated Evaluation Metrics: If you have a gold standard dataset (i.e., a dataset where the correct answers are known), you can use automated evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for the QA system, and ROUGE scores for the summarization system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heuristic Evaluation: Use established usability heuristics to evaluate your system. For example, is the system consistent? Does it provide feedback to the user about what it's doing? Is the system efficient to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Tracking: Measure how long it takes to summarize a log file, answer a question, or highlight relevant lines. This can give you a sense of the system's efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal isn't to be perfect - it's to learn as much as possible in a short amount of time. Even if you're working alone, you can still get a lot of valuable feedback by critically evaluating your own work."
