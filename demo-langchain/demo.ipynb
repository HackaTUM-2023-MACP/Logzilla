The question is whether or not it would be safe to get out of the car.\\n\\nComment: @JamesK.Politano I was thinking about the same thing, but I thought maybe the OP meant that the car was on fire because of the fuel leak.\\n\\n## Answer (1)\\n\\nI'm not sure if this is relevant, but I have seen cars on fire before. In one case, the car was parked in a parking lot and someone had left their cigarette lighter on. The car caught fire and burned down completely.\\n\\nIn another case, a car was involved in a high-speed crash and caught fire. The driver managed to escape, but the car was completely destroyed.\\n\\nIn both cases, the flames were intense enough to melt metal. However, they were also intense enough to cause severe burns to anyone who came near them.\\n\\nSo, if you were in a car that was on fire, it would probably be best to stay inside until the fire was extinguished. If you tried to get out, you could suffer severe burns.\""
